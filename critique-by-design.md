# Critique By Design - How Many People in Each State Make Minimum Wage or Less

![Map of minimum wages](Map.jpg)

I chose to critique this design because I thought it already looked relatively nice, but as they say, there is always room for improvement. I wanted to figure out how to improve this design to be more beneficial to a different audience. 

Originally, my goal was to see what people think is important for this topic. I did not update the numbers from the 2017 information given in the original chart so that I could make a visualization that only contains the same information but in a different way. Therefore, I created this series of data charts to receive feedback on.

  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='1016px';vizElement.style.height='991px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';

The feedback I received was not what I was going for. I thought I had created a great set of data to tell a story with, but it was not read the same way by my audience. I went back to the drawing board. I decided to make a more specific story that I wanted to tell. Instead of just using the data from 2017 as the original chart uses, I chose to make a visualization that utilizes all of the information provided to create a look over time for a different comparison. My new focus became to show how Pennsylvania compares with its 19 other states who recognize the federal minimum wage as their state's minimum wage. 

At first I only included Pennsylvania's information. It looks great and can tell a great, one-sided story. I thought that I found the perfect chart, so I asked the same people for feedback on this new visualization. My results were more what I was looking for, but there was something that stuck out to me. When asked if the viewer would do anything different, one respondant said they would like to see a comparison with the rest of the states. 

So, back to the drawing board I went. I could tell a story that paints Pennsylvania in the best light, or I could look at the rest of the data and tell a true story. I went back to my data and created new tables and finding national averages to compare to Pennsylvania. I was shocked to find that Pennsyvania was not performing as well as I initially thought. This made me want to create a chart to show Pennsylvania's specific progress, but also a comparison to the other states who recognize the federal minimum wage as their own minimum wage.
