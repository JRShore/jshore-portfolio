# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

I chose to build out my Wireframe in Shorthand. During this process, I learned that looking for data for all the fine arts became increasingly difficult to make the argument for the entire arts sector. That being said, I know the most about sources for music data because of my background in music education. My main sections were Music Helps You Feel, Music Helps You Learn, Current Student Performance, What Else Can Music Do?, and What You Can Do for Your K-12 Student. 

The first two sections are introductory to the topic, helping the audience be aware of the topic, music and education. This section does not have any statistical information, instead it asks the audience rhetorical questions to get them thinking. 

Then next section, Current Student Performance, data becomes integrated into text with callout statistics and simple graphs. I chose to use simple and easy-to-understand visualizations because of my specific audience, which you will read more about in the next section. I did not want to spend too much time "beating a dead horse" by bringing in a bunch of studies about poor student performance.
