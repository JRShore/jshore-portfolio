# Wireframes / storyboards

I chose to build out my Wireframe in Shorthand. During this process, I learned that looking for data for all the fine arts became increasingly difficult to make the argument for the entire arts sector. That being said, I know the most about sources for music data because of my background in music education. My main sections were Music Helps You Feel, Music Helps You Learn, Current Student Performance, What Else Can Music Do?, and What You Can Do for Your K-12 Student. 

The first two sections are introductory to the topic, helping the audience be aware of the topic, music and education. This section does not have any statistical information, instead it asks the audience rhetorical questions to get them thinking. 

Then next section, Current Student Performance, data becomes integrated into text with callout statistics and simple graphs. I chose to use simple and easy-to-understand visualizations because of my specific audience, which you will read more about in the next section. I did not want to spend too much time "beating a dead horse" by bringing in a bunch of studies about poor student performance. 

I then introduce data that shows that engaging with music increases students' reading and mathematics abilities. Additionally, music is able to help students think creatively and learn important social skills, such as working as part of a team. It is easy to find written reports on this data, however it is much more difficult to find the data that the reports are written over, mostly because it is confidential information since it involves minors in the studies. I pulled information from the reports as well as graphs already designed to envision the graphs that are on Shorthand. 

Finally, my "call-to-action" is for the audience to help their students change their academic behaviors by engaging in music courses either in school or out of school. 49 of the 50 states have state legislature requiring music to be taught as part of a well-rounded education, however, most states only require a single credit of any fine arts class to graduate. I am giving the audience resources to reports and national data showing the importance of music for the social and academic developments of children and encouraging the audience to talk to their students about enrolling in a music course, especially for more than a year. 

# User research 



## Target audience

My Target Audience is the parents of K-12 students, primarily in the public school systems. Less targeted, but still applicable audiences are also teachers of any age and subject, school board members, superintendants, principals, and anyone who votes and/or affects the budget alotted for music programs in schools. The goal is that this group of people will encourage students to enroll in music courses, stop cutting the budget for music, and increase opportunities for music classes in schools. 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Make the presentation easy to read | Are does the order and flow of the topics discussed make sense? |
| Use easy language, without jargon, that someone at or above an 8th-grade reading level will understand | Are there any words or phrases that are hard to understand? Do you think an 8th-grader could read and understand this presentation? |
| Utilize images and visualizations to facilitate the reading, not just fill space | Do you think the images and visualizations contribute to the understanding of the presentation? |
| Clearly written for the target audience | Do you know who the target audience is? |
| Have a clear theme/color scheme | Can you recognize a theme and/or color scheme? |
| Keep it clear and concise | Do you see any fluffy, unneccesary, or repetative words or phrases? |
| Input | What changes would you make to this presentation and why? |
| Sufficient data | Is there information missing? What else would you want to know to move forward with the call-to-action? |
