# Wireframes / Storyboards

I chose to build out my Wireframe in Shorthand. During this process, I learned that looking for data for all the fine arts became increasingly difficult to make the argument for the entire arts sector. That being said, I know the most about sources for music data because of my background in music education. My main sections were Music Helps You Feel, Music Helps You Learn, Current Student Performance, What Else Can Music Do?, and What You Can Do for Your K-12 Student. 

The first two sections are introductory to the topic, helping the audience be aware of the topic, music and education. This section does not have any statistical information, instead it asks the audience rhetorical questions to get them thinking. 

Then next section, Current Student Performance, data becomes integrated into text with callout statistics and simple graphs. I chose to use simple and easy-to-understand visualizations because of my specific audience, which you will read more about in the next section. I did not want to spend too much time "beating a dead horse" by bringing in a bunch of studies about poor student performance. 

I then introduce data that shows that engaging with music increases students' reading and mathematics abilities. Additionally, music is able to help students think creatively and learn important social skills, such as working as part of a team. It is easy to find written reports on this data, however it is much more difficult to find the data that the reports are written over, mostly because it is confidential information since it involves minors in the studies. I pulled information from the reports as well as graphs already designed to envision the graphs that are on Shorthand. 

Finally, my "call-to-action" is for the audience to help their students change their academic behaviors by engaging in music courses either in school or out of school. 49 of the 50 states have state legislature requiring music to be taught as part of a well-rounded education, however, most states only require a single credit of any fine arts class to graduate. I am giving the audience resources to reports and national data showing the importance of music for the social and academic developments of children and encouraging the audience to talk to their students about enrolling in a music course, especially for more than a year. 

# User Research 
Having spent 5 years studying music education, I became very familiar with parents and their mind-sets. I also became aware of the conflicts between music educators, parents, school boards, and principals. This background information in the subject at hand helped me to organize who my target audience would be...all of the people who are often in conflict with music educators about the importance of the subjects they teach.

## Target Audience

My Target Audience is the parents of K-12 students, primarily in the public school systems. Less targeted, but still applicable audiences are also teachers of any age and subject, school board members, superintendents, principals, and anyone who votes and/or affects the budget alotted for music programs in schools. The goal is that this group of people will encourage students to enroll in music courses, stop cutting the budget for music, and increase opportunities for music classes in schools. 

## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Make the presentation easy to read | Does the order and flow of the topics discussed make sense? |
| Use easy language, without jargon, that someone at or above an 8th-grade reading level will understand | Are there any words or phrases that are hard to understand? Do you think an 8th-grader could read and understand this presentation? |
| Utilize images and visualizations to facilitate the reading, not just fill space | Do you think the images and visualizations contribute to the understanding of the presentation? |
| Clearly written for the target audience | Do you know who the target audience is? |
| Have a clear theme/color scheme | Can you recognize a theme and/or color scheme? |
| Keep it clear and concise | Do you see any fluffy, unnecessary, or repetitive words or phrases? |
| Input | What changes would you make to this presentation and why? |
| Sufficient data | Is there information missing? What else would you want to know to move forward with the call-to-action? |

## Interview Findings

| Questions               | Interview 1, male late 20s | Interview 2, female mid 50s | Interview 3, female early 30s |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does the order and flow of the topics discussed make sense? | Yes | Yes | Absolutely! I understood how each element of the presentation tied in with the others, and how each part supported your overall thesis. Nothing struck me as odd or like it didn't fit. |
| Are there any words or phrases that are hard to understand? Do you think an 8th-grader could read and understand this presentation? | 8th-grade me would definitely understand this since I was in music myself. I didn't find anything that was hard to understand. I think a well-studied 8th-grader will make sense of the presentation. | No. Yes. | I found it very easy to understand! There weren't any words or phrases that stuck out as difficult or unclear.  Not sure about the 8th graders, since 30% of them aren't reading at an 8th-grade level ;) (sorry, couldn't resist being cheeky here!) |
| Do you think the images and visualizations contribute to the understanding of the presentation? | Yes | Yes | Yes; the images were well-chosen. |
| Do you know who the target audience is? | Adults of children in school. | School board / parents | Yes |
| Can you recognize a theme and/or color scheme? | Music helps us learn better. | The color Maze or goldenrod-ish and the theme seemed how music makes a person feel and the important role it plays in education. | Also yes, the color scheme was very consistent. |
| Do you see any fluffy, unnecessary, or repetitive words or phrases? | No | No | There are a few places where the language could be trimmed down a bit, but that's really just if I'm being very nitpicky. I definitely don't see any significant swaths of fluff or glaring repetition. |
| What changes would you make to this presentation and why? | I don't know of any that I would make at this moment in time. | None. I believe it is well done. The way it draws the viewers in by asking how the clips make them feel, then going into the importance of music and the role music can play in helping one remember things. Heck, I loved Schoolhouse Rock growing up...it's how I learned about sentence structure (Conjunction Junction), how I learned about bills becoming a law (I'm just a Bill) and I immediately remembered the song of the video put in about the preamble. | The most significant change I'd make would be to delve a bit deeper into the "why music benefits kids" section.  It seemed like more time/detail was spent on kids' test scores being down, rather than the reasons music education will help solve it.  I'm talking about the "What Can Music Do?" section -- so not including the following section, which is a call to action.  I found myself wanting more detail and information about what music does for kids' brains.   |
| Is there information missing? What else would you want to know to move forward with the call-to-action? | None that I can think of. | I think it was perfect the way it is. | Ah -- I guess I sort of just answered this.  But yeah, I think if you flesh out the "What Can Music Do?" part, the call to action will fit together with it beautifully! |


# Identified Changes for Part III

I will dig through my research again and spend more time actually explaining the benefits of music to counter the research showing the the poor performance of school-aged children.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| My theme/color scheme is consistent throughout the presentation. | I will not make any changes to the color scheme or backgrounds chosen. |
| While people who know and have studied music said I provided enough information, when asking someone who hasn't studied for several years of their life, they wanted for information. | I will include more about the findings from the research into the presentation, creating more charts, to help guide the for the benefits of music education. |


While it is only required to have 3 interviews, I will ask one or two more people for feedback to give better insight for improvements. I will ask another person who is not knowledgeable about music, since my target audience is less likely to be well-versed in the benefits of music.
