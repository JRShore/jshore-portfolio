# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi I'm Jenna! I was born and raised near Kansas City, Missouri where I spent my childhood participating in choirs, musicals, dance, and band. I love everything that has to do with music! I studied Music Education with an emphasis in vocal music for my bachelor's degree and upon graduation I moved to Pittsburgh, PA to attend the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University to obtain my Master of Arts Manageent degree. I will complete my Systems Synthesis Project in the spring semester of 2024 and graduate in May of 2024. After graduation, I hope to land a job working for an opera organization in community engagement or in general operations management. 

I am taking Telling Stories with Data so that I may be better equiped to create convincing charts, graphs, mind maps, and more to be able to convey the importance of music as it relates to education and social development. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to utilize color theory to make charts easier to read and draw attention to the correct details that I want to highlight. I also hope to learn how to choose the data that I want to use to convey the story that I am wanting to tell without data manipulation to change the story. I am also excited to use tools I have never used before, such as Github, Tableau, and others. The world of data is new to me, so I hope that this will be a great introductory course to figure out where to begin my dive into the world of data and research.

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt) 
[Data Visualizations](/visualizing-government-debt.md)

All the information provided in the visualizations comes from [OCED.org's Data Page](https://data.oecd.org/). Thie first visualization is a simple bar chart showing the Debt-to-GDP ratio for all countries who reported in 2018. The only bar highlighted is the OECD average. This chart comes directly from the [OECD Data](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) website. The next chart is a detailed heat map of all the data collected from 1995 until 2022. The blues are less than 100% while the oranges are greater than 100% and the neutrals are right at 100%. The spaces without information are where there is not information for that country reported in that year. This heat map provides a lot of information and makes it easier to locate which countries are performing better than others in a given year and over time. The disadvantages to this sort of chart is that there are many aspects to look at and the eyes can become distracted. It also makes it difficult to chart only a couple countries for comparisons since each country is colored.

The final visualization is a double bar graph in which the audience can easily compare 2019 Debt-to-GDP ratios with 2022 ratios. These years were specifically chosen to indicate how each country was performing in 2019, prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and in 2022 after most countries have returned to some sense of normalcy in the "post"-pandemic world. The United States is highlighted in red to draw the audience's attention immediately for a focus on US debt. Then the audience will notice the light-blue highlighted bars, which are countries who compare similarly to the United States regarding tourism and innovation. The remaining countries are left gray as background information that may be useful for other purposes, but is not the important topic. Utilizing this chart helps eliminate granular data, such as what was provided with the heat map, and show a "pause in time" for how each country fared from the pandemic. Without a lot of context, this chart allows the reader to quickly identify important information.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
