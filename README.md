# About me
Hi I'm Jenna! I was born and raised near Kansas City, Missouri where I spent my childhood participating in choirs, musicals, dance, and band. I love everything that has to do with music! I studied Music Education with an emphasis in vocal music for my bachelor's degree and upon graduation I moved to Pittsburgh, PA to attend the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University to obtain my Master of Arts Manageent degree. I will complete my Systems Synthesis Project in the spring semester of 2024 and graduate in May of 2024. After graduation, I hope to land a job working for an opera organization in community engagement or in general operations management. 

I am taking Telling Stories with Data so that I may be better equiped to create convincing charts, graphs, mind maps, and more to be able to convey the importance of music as it relates to education and social development. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to utilize color theory to make charts easier to read and draw attention to the correct details that I want to highlight. I also hope to learn how to choose the data that I want to use to convey the story that I am wanting to tell without data manipulation to change the story. I am also excited to use tools I have never used before, such as Github, Tableau, and others. The world of data is new to me, so I hope that this will be a great introductory course to figure out where to begin my dive into the world of data and research.
